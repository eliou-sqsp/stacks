# React application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Then an Express server was added in the `server` directory. The server is proxied via the `proxy` key in `package.json`.


## Starting

Clone the project, change into the directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
npm i
tsc
npm run dev
```

The React application will run on port 3000 and the server port 3001.
